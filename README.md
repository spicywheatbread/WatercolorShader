# Watercolor Shader Project

## Introduction
Hello! This is repo for my watercolor shader project. This is a project final for my CS216 class with Kevin Smith. I was researching for interesting visual effects to try to create, and I found this [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0097849317300316) that detailed a real-time watercolor style as a post-processing effect. I implemented the method found in the paper as an exercise in learning to research how visual effects are created and creating my own implementation.
